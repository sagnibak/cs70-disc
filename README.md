# Sagnik's Teaching Materials

I have taught CS 189 and CS 70 as a TA and as a
[Computer Science Mentor](https://csmentors.berkeley.edu/) for several
semesters. This repository contains all the teaching materials that I
have created/used over the years.

## CS 189 (Machine Learning)
- [Code](/189-code)
- [Spring 2021](/sp21)
- Spring 2020: This is in another repo, I will add it here sometime later.

## CS 70 (Discrete Math and Probability Theory)
- [Code](/70-code)
- [CSM Spring 2021](/csm-sp21)
- [Fall 2020](/fa20)
- [CSM Fall 2020](/csm-fa20)
- [Summer 2020](/su20)
- CSM was in-person in Fall 2019 and Spring 2020, so I don't have any online materials for those semesters :sweat_smile:.
